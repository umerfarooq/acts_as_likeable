ActsAsLikeable
==============

== Resources

Install
 * Run the following command:
 * ./script/plugin install git@github.com:umerfarooq/acts_as_likeable.git

 * Create a new rails migration and add the following self.up and self.down methods

  def self.up
    create_table "likings", :force => true do |t|
      t.column "liking", :boolean, :default => false
      t.column "created_at", :datetime, :null => false
      t.column "likeable_type", :string, :limit => 15, :default => "", :null => false
      t.column "likeable_id", :integer, :default => 0, :null => false
      t.column "user_id", :integer, :default => 0, :null => false
    end

    add_index "likings", ["user_id"], :name => "fk_likings_user"
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :likings
  end

== Usage
 * Make your ActiveRecord model act as likeable.

 class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_likeable
 end

 * Add a liking to a model instance

 model = Model.new
 liking = Liking.new(:liking => 1) (0=dislike, 1=like)
 model.likings << liking / model.add_liking(liking)

 * Each liking references the likeable object

 model = Model.find(1)
 model.likings.get(0).likeable == model

 * Count total likes of the likeable object

 model.find(1)
 model.likes_count (Count of Likes)

 * Count total dislikes of the likeable object

 model.find(1)
 model.dislikes_count (Count of DisLikes)

* Count percentage of likes to dislikes for the likeable object

 model.find(1)
 model.likes_percentage

* Count percentage of dislikes to likes for the likeable object

 model.find(1)
 model.dislikes_percentage

== Inspiration

This Plugin is heavily influenced by acts_as_voteable & acts_as_rateable,
can be used for Thumbs Up/Down or Likes/Dislikes situations, also helps to
get the Percentage of Likes to Dislikes and vice versa on an Object, to depict
average popularity.
